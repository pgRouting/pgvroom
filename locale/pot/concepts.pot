msgid "VROOM is an open-source optimization engine that aims at providing good solutions to various real-life vehicle routing problems (VRP) within a small computing time."

msgid "Characteristics"
msgstr ""

msgid "VROOM models a Vehicle Routing Problem with ``vehicles``, ``jobs`` and ``shipments``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The **vehicles** denote the resources that pick and/or deliver the jobs and shipments. They are characterised by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Capacity on arbitrary number of metrics"
msgstr ""

msgid "Skills"
msgstr ""

msgid "Working hours"
msgstr ""

msgid "Driver breaks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start and end defined on a per-vehicle basis"
msgstr ""

msgid "Start and end can be different"
msgstr ""

msgid "Open trip optimization (only start or only end defined)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The **jobs** denote the single-location pickup and/or delivery tasks, and the **shipments** denote the pickup-and-delivery tasks that should happen within the same route. They are characterised by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Delivery/pickup amounts on arbitrary number of metrics"
msgstr ""

msgid "Service time windows"
msgstr ""

msgid "Service duration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Priority"
msgstr ""

msgid "Terminologies"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Tasks**: Either jobs or shipments are referred to as tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Skills**: Every task and vehicle may have some set of skills. A task can be served by only that vehicle which has all the skills of the task."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Priority**: Tasks may have some priority assigned, which is useful when all tasks cannot be performed due to constraints, so the tasks with low priority are left unassigned."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Amount (for shipment), Pickup and delivery (for job)**: They denote the multidimensional quantities such as number of items, weights, volume, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Capacity (for vehicle)**: Every vehicle may have some capacity, denoting the multidimensional quantities. A vehicle can serve only those sets of tasks such that the total sum of the quantity does not exceed the vehicle capacity, at any point of the route."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Time Window**: An interval of time during which some activity can be performed, such as working hours of the vehicle, break of the vehicle, or service start time for a task."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Break**: Array of time windows, denoting valid slots for the break start of a vehicle."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Setup time**: Setup times serve as a mean to describe the time it takes to get started for a task at a given location. This models a duration that should not be re-applied for other tasks following at the same place. So the total \"action time\" for a task is ``setup + service`` upon arriving at a new location or ``service`` only if performing a new task at the previous vehicle location."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Service time**: The additional time to be spent by a vehicle while serving a task."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Travel time**: The total time the vehicle travels during its route."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Waiting time**: The total time the vehicle is idle, i.e. it is neither traveling nor servicing any task. It is generally the time spent by a vehicle waiting for a task service to open."
msgstr ""
