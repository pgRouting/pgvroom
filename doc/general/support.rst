Reporting Problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs are reported and managed in an
`issue tracker <https://github.com/pgRouting/pgvroom/issues>`_. Please follow
these steps:

1. Search the tickets to see if your problem has already been reported.
   If so, add any extra context you might have found, or at least indicate that
   you too are having the problem. This will help us prioritize common issues.
2. If your problem is unreported, create a
   `new issue <https://github.com/pgRouting/pgvroom/issues/new>`__ for it.
3. In your report include explicit instructions to replicate your issue.
   The best tickets include the exact SQL necessary to replicate a problem.
4. For the versions where you can replicate the problem, note the operating
   system and version of pgvroom and PostgreSQL.
5. It is recommended to use the following wrapper on the problem to pin point
   the step that is causing the problem.

.. code-block:: sql

    SET client_min_messages TO debug;
      <your code>
    SET client_min_messages TO notice;
