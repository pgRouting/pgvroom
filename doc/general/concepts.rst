.. contents::

VROOM is an open-source optimization engine that aims at providing good solutions
to various real-life vehicle routing problems (VRP) within a small computing time.

VROOM can solve several well-known types of vehicle routing problems (VRP).

- TSP (travelling salesman problem)
- CVRP (capacitated VRP)
- VRPTW (VRP with time windows)
- MDHVRPTW (multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle VRPTW)
- PDPTW (pickup-and-delivery problem with TW)

VROOM can also solve any mix of the above problem types.

Characteristics
...............................................................................

VROOM models a Vehicle Routing Problem with ``vehicles``, ``jobs`` and ``shipments``.

The **vehicles** denote the resources that pick and/or deliver the jobs and shipments.
They are characterised by:

- Capacity on arbitrary number of metrics
- Skills
- Working hours
- Driver breaks
- Start and end defined on a per-vehicle basis
- Start and end can be different
- Open trip optimization (only start or only end defined)

The **jobs** denote the single-location pickup and/or delivery tasks, and the **shipments**
denote the pickup-and-delivery tasks that should happen within the same route.
They are characterised by:

- Delivery/pickup amounts on arbitrary number of metrics
- Service time windows
- Service duration
- Skills
- Priority

Terminologies
...............................................................................

- **Tasks**: Either jobs or shipments are referred to as tasks.
- **Skills**: Every task and vehicle may have some set of skills. A task can be
  served by only that vehicle which has all the skills of the task.
- **Priority**: Tasks may have some priority assigned, which is useful when all
  tasks cannot be performed due to constraints, so the tasks with low priority
  are left unassigned.
- **Amount (for shipment), Pickup and delivery (for job)**: They denote the
  multidimensional quantities such as number of items, weights, volume, etc.
- **Capacity (for vehicle)**: Every vehicle may have some capacity, denoting the
  multidimensional quantities. A vehicle can serve only those sets of tasks such
  that the total sum of the quantity does not exceed the vehicle capacity, at
  any point of the route.
- **Time Window**: An interval of time during which some activity can be
  performed, such as working hours of the vehicle, break of the vehicle, or
  service start time for a task.
- **Break**: Array of time windows, denoting valid slots for the break start of
  a vehicle.
- **Setup time**: Setup times serve as a mean to describe the time it takes to
  get started for a task at a given location.
  This models a duration that should not be re-applied for other tasks following
  at the same place.
  So the total "action time" for a task is ``setup + service`` upon arriving at
  a new location or ``service`` only if performing a new task at the previous
  vehicle location.
- **Service time**: The additional time to be spent by a vehicle while serving a
  task.
- **Travel time**: The total time the vehicle travels during its route.
- **Waiting time**: The total time the vehicle is idle, i.e. it is neither
  traveling nor servicing any task. It is generally the time spent by a vehicle
  waiting for a task service to open.

Getting Started
...............................................................................

This is a simple guide to walk you through the steps of getting started
with pgvroom. In this guide we will cover:

Inner Queries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vroom, because of the data types used internally, some maximum values apply.

For ``TIMESTAMP``:

.. literalinclude:: concepts.queries
   :start-after: q1

  task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process.
- If ``start_id`` is omitted, the resulting route will start at the first
  visited task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process.
- To request a round trip, specify both ``start_id`` and ``end_id`` as the same
  index.
- A vehicle is only allowed to serve a set of tasks if the resulting load at
  each route step is lower than the matching value in capacity for each metric.
  When using multiple components for amounts, it is recommended to put the most
  important/limiting metrics first.
- It is assumed that all delivery-related amounts for jobs are loaded at vehicle
  start, while all pickup-related amounts for jobs are brought back at vehicle
  end.

    - Let the beginning of the planning horizon :math:`0`.
    - for a 4 hour time window (:math:`4 * 3600 = 14400` seconds) starting from
      the planning horizon

      - ``tw_open`` = :math:`0`
      - ``tw_close`` = :math:`14400`

    - Times reported in output relative to the start of the planning horizon.

  - **Absolute values**,

    - Let the beginning of the planning horizon ``2019-07-30 08:00:00``
    - for a 4 hour time window starting from the planning horizon
