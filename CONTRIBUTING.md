## Contribution agreement

Any kind of contribution will automatically fall to the following Licences:

* Code contribution: GNU General Public License v2.0 or later,
  * Directly by making an explicit pull request.
  * Indirectly by posting code on issues/wiki/gitter/discourse

* Documentation contribution:

Contributions developed for an employer or as part of a work project also fall
under the above licences. This should be cleared with an authorized supervisor
or manager in advance.

Contributions should be developed by the contributor, from the public domain,
or from an open source project under a compatible licence. If the code does not
come from the contributor, the original source should be clearly marked.

Do not remove existing copyright headers and licence text from contributions.
If the copyright holder wants to give up copyright, they must do so in writing
before any copyright messages are deleted.

## Submitting changes

Write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small
changes, but bigger changes should have more information.

Fill in the commit message template.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for
readability.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and
make it look nice for them.

* Use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) on your editor to get the
  coding conventions

Thanks,
pgRouting team
